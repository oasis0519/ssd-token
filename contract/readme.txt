i would want you do some update on d3

we have started buying some asset accross different chain

we need a left Tab called

D3 index

it will list all out assets

we need to list all assets in the treasury already , then add new assets

how fast can it be done

it should be made easy so i can easily add new asset and update

Since we already have a treasury balance from all bonds .

We can fetch other asset which will be in a single wallet address

We fetch all assets form different chains and add it up the the already treasury

We have a table showing , assets name , asset quantity, amount in USDT

We can usd the bond style of table and presentation

the purchased tab will be balance

the emission will be available token

like currently now

we have about 5 tokens not in our treasury we would like to add in the D3 index page
